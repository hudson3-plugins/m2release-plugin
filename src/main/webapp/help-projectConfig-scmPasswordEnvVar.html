	If defined, an environment variable with this name will hold the scm password when triggering a release build (this is the password the user enters when triggering a release build, not the password given to Hudson SCM configuration of the job).<br />
    As the passed passwords would potentially get written to the logs and therefore visible to users, we recommend you to install the <a href="https://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mask+Passwords+Plugin">Mask Password Plugin</a>.
